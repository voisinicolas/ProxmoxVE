        ## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT - READ FIRST**  
        - 🔍 **Search first:** Before submitting, check if the issue has already been reported or resolved in [closed issues](https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed). If found, comment on that issue instead of creating a new one.  
        Alternatively, check the **[Discussions](https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/discussions)** under the *"Announcement"* or *"Guide"* categories for relevant information.  
        - 🔎 If you encounter `[ERROR] in line 23: exit code *: while executing command "$@" > /dev/null 2>&1`, rerun the script with verbose mode before submitting the issue.  
        - 📜 **Read the script:** Familiarize yourself with the script's content and its purpose. This will help you understand the issue better and provide more relevant information

        Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! Please provide as much detail as possible to help us address the problem efficiently.
